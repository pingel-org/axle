Adam Pingel is an Iowa native who wrote his first lines of code on an Apple ][ in 1983.

He moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1992 to study Computer Science at Stanford.
After graduating in 1996, spent several years at Excite.com, helping it scale to become the 3rd largest site on the web at the time.  After Excite he spent two years at NOCpulse -- a startup acquired by Red Hat.

In 2002 he left Silicon Valley to join the UCLA Computer Science department's PhD program.
His major field was programming languages and systems, and his minor fields were AI and Linguistics.
His first year he worked as a TA for the undergraduate Artificial Intelligence class.
The second was spent as a graduate student researcher working on programming tools for artists at
the Hypermedia Lab (a part of the UCLA School of Theater, Film, and Television).
From 2005 - 2009 he mixed graduate studies with consulting.
He received an MS along the way, and ultimately decided to pursue his research interests in the open source community.

In April 2009 he moved to San Francisco and joined the Independent Online Distribution Alliance (IODA) as the Lead Systems Engineer.
During his time there, IODA was acquired by Sony Music and then The Orchard.
In April 2012 he co-founded Eddgy.
In May 2013 he joined VigLink as Staff Software Engineer and later managed a team there.
In September 2015 he became VP of Engineering at Ravel Law.
In June 2017 Ravel Law was acquired by LexisNexis, where he became a Sr. Director.
In late 2019, he became the CTO of Global Platforms.
In early 2022, he joined IBM's [Accelerated Science](https://research.ibm.com/teams/accelerated-discovery) team as a technical lead.

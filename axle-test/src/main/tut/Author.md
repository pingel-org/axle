From 2005 - 2009 he mixed graduate studies with consulting.
He received an MS along the way, and ultimately decided to pursue his research interests in the open source community.

In April 2009 he moved to San Francisco and joined the Independent Online Distribution Alliance (IODA) as the Lead Systems Engineer.
During his time there, IODA was acquired by Sony Music and then The Orchard.
